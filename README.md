# implement-of-CLRS
This repository contains my implement of some algorithms in CLRS

#Dynamic programming
only a classic question rod cutting

#string matching
contains the Rabin krap algorithm and automata algorithm.
Use these algorithms to find the occurances of a given pattern in the text.
Solving a trivial case, which the alphabet is only {'a','b','c'}
